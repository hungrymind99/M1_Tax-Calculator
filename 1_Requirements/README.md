  *Requirements for your project
    *What, why, when, who, how
    *Analysis on strength, weakness, opportunity, threats in my developed project
    *High level(features) and Low level requirements(How is it implemented)
 #Design
   *Structural
   *Behavioural
 #Implement
   * C program implementation
 #Test Plan & Outcome
   *How is the feature tested/verified - steps for each requirement captured (High level and Low level requirements)
   *Once implemented, test and capture the outcome
